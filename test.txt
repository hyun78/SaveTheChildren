Well, good night, folks. Come again. Thought those deadbeats would never leave. Closin' time, SpongeBob.
There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye.
Time to pack it in, Sponge- Bah! Wha?!
All ready, Mr. Krabs. Just gotta clock out and...
SpongeBob, what's the meaning of this?
Spot, spot, spot!
That's right, a spot. You know the rule. Nobody leaves work till...
...till everything's ship-shape, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy.
Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done.
Lock up? Wait, Mr. Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone?
Should've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates. But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right? Now, get to work.
Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. You're a tough little guy, aren't ya? This means war. Wait here, please. Say good-night, dried on filth. Ready. Aim. Fire! That is the last straw! I want you to remember... you made me do this. Yaahhhh! I got to finish this. I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the Spot-Master 6000. Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleaning materials. I call it... ...steel wool! And it comes with... a laser! Any last words? Mmm... I thought not. Power up. Water cannon... on. No effect. Steel wool laser... on!
Hmmm... strange vortex in the west. Well, it's probably got nothing to do with SpongeBob.
OK, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams! More power!
Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm? I guess I better go see what the lad's up to.
More power!
Oh, boy, that can't be good.
More power!
Let's see what he's done this time.
Maximum power! Ahhhhh!
Oh, this time you've done it, boy. What've you got to say for yourself?
The platter's all clean, Mr. Krabs.
Oh, I'll clean your platter! Come here, you!
