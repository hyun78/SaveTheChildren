<Coyote¡¯s Crying Song> This is the story of Coyote¡¯s crying song. It comes from the Native American people, the Hopi people in the Southwest of the United States. And Coyote is a trickster and sometimes he¡¯s very foolish. Sometimes he tricks others and sometimes he is tricked. The story starts, actually, with Little Dove. Little Grey Dove was scratching in the quaqua grass when, oh, she cut her foot at the edge of a sharp blade of grass. ¡°Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh.¡± Along came Coyote, ¡°Hey, Little Dove! I like that song you¡¯re singing.¡± ¡°Oh no, Coyote, I am not singing a song. I cut my foot on the quaqua grass and I¡¯m crying. Ohhhhhhh.¡± ¡°Oh no no, no,¡± said the Coyote, ¡°I know a good song when I hear it. Teach me that song.¡± ¡°No, no, no, no Coyote, it¡¯s not a song. I was crying.¡± ¡°Teach me that song or I might bite you!¡± ¡°Ohhhh, ohhhhh,ohhhhh.¡± ¡°I got it! Said Coyote. And he went off across the prairie singing, ¡°Wooooo, woooo, woooo.¡± You got that? You can sing it with me. ¡°Woooo, woooo, wooooo, wooooo, woooo" ; He tripped over his own big, fat feet and the song went right out of his head. ¡°Oh, now how did that song go? Um. High-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi. No, that wasn¡¯t it. It was like, hiyoooooooooooo. No, that wasn¡¯t it. Um. Wheeeeeeee. No, that wasn¡¯t it. I¡¯ll have to go back and ask Little Dove.¡± So he went back and he said, ¡°Little Dove, you¡¯ll never guess what. I tripped over my big feet, the song went out of my head. Teach me that song again.¡± Little Dove said, ¡°Coyote, that wasn¡¯t a song. I was crying because I cut my foot on the quaqua grass.¡± ¡°No, no, no,no,no,no Dove. I know a song when I hear it. Teach me that song.¡± ¡°Coyote I--¡° ¡°Teach me that song or I¡¯ll bite you!¡± ¡°Ohhhhh, ohhhhh,ohhhhhh.¡± ¡°Got it! Woowoowoo! Come on. ¡°Woowooo-" He tripped over his big, fat feet again. ¡°Oh, now, how did that song go? Let me see¡¦ Me me me me me me me me me. No, that wasn¡¯t it. Ah, ah, I know what it was like. Meeeeeeeyyyyy yooooooooo. No, that wasn¡¯t it. Um. I¡¯ll have to go back and ask Little Dove.¡± ¡°Hey Little Dove, you¡¯ll never guess what. I tripped over my feet, the song went out of my head. Teach me that song again.¡± Little Dove said, ¡°Coyote, it wasn¡¯t a song! I was crying because I cut my foot on the quaqua grass!¡± ¡°Teach me that song or I might bite you.¡± ¡°Ohhhhh, ohhhhh,ohhhhh.¡± ¡°Got it,¡± said Coyote. And off he went again, ¡°Wooowooowooowooowo--.¡± Oh, he tripped over his big feet again, the song went out of his head. ¡°Oh, how did that go? Let me see. Hmmmmm. Ooooga ooooga ooooga. No, that¡¯s not it. Ah, let me see. Hmmmmmmmm. No, that wasn¡¯t it. I know. Yoda-lay-ee-who. Oh, that wasn¡¯t it. I¡¯ll have to ask Little Dove again.¡± Meanwhile Little Dove was thinking, ¡°That stupid Coyote, he is going to keep coming back and asking me for the song, which is crying. I¡¯m getting out of here, but he might follow me. I will have to play a trick on him.¡± So Little Dove looked around and found a nice gray stone, the same color and size as herself. And she put that stone down in the quaqua grass. And then she found a couple little berries and she went to make eyes on that stone. And just in time she got away because along came Coyote who said. ¡°Little Dove, guess what? I tripped over my feet, the song went out of my head, teach me that song again.¡± The rock said nothing. ¡°Hey, Little Dove. Yoo-hoo! It¡¯s me Coyote, teach me that song.¡± The rock said nothing. ¡°Hey Little Dove, teach me that song or I might bite you!¡± The rock said nothing. ¡°All right,¡± said Coyote, ¡°you asked for it. Ahh- woooo! Ah-wooooo!¡± Along came Crow. ¡°Ah ah ah! Hey Coyote, I like that song you¡¯re singing.¡± But Coyote said, ¡°Hey, what¡¯s the matter with you? Don¡¯t you know the difference between a song and crying?¡± And to this very day coyotes still sing their crying song. You can sing it with me. Ah-wooooo! Ah-ah-ah-ah-woooooo!
