[the episode starts in the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Squidward are trying to fit all the trash in one trash bag.]
Squidward: You're just filthy trash! [tries to use SpongeBob to block the trash from overflowing] Get in the bag! Stupid trash! [The trash splashes Squidward with trash juice.] [disgusted] Trash juice!
SpongeBob: [upside down] Hey, maybe we should use another trash bag, Mr. Krabs. [shows a view of the stretched trashbag] This one's kinda full.
Mr. Krabs: Forget it, boyo! [zooms to Mr. Krabs] I'm not paying for another garbage bag! Just put your back into it.
SpongeBob: Back, ey? Like this? [jumps on the garbage bag using his back, then rubs himself in the trash using his back.]
Squidward: Ooh, let me help you with that. [Squidward "helps" SpongeBob by jumping on him.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Let me try! [throws a chunk of trash in the air, then puts his body parts in the chunk and "helps" Squidward by jumping on his body.]
Mr. Krabs: Keep it up, it's working! [Mr. Krabs laughs]
SpongeBob: Keeping it up, Mr. Krabs. [jumps very high and lands on the trash bag, making it tear, Squidward falls from the trash bag then Dave throws the empty cup inside the trash bag, making the trash explode into all of Bikini Bottom then the Trash Inspectors go to the Krusty Krab then the Green Trash Inspector breaks his shades]
Purple Trash Inspector: [talking through a walkie talkie] Come in, base, we found the trash slingers. [he gets a mop and pokes SpongeBob and Squidward; the other inspector uses a toothpick to taste the trash]
Green Trash Inspector: Just as I thought, saving money on trash bags.
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] I don't know what you're talking about sir.
Purple Trash Inspector: Call us trash inspector not sir, we didn't go to garbage school for nothing [raises ring with the other inspector
Both: Go, Fight Filthies!
Mr. Krabs: Whatever you say inspector.
Green Trash Inspector: What I say is...[puts on a powdered wig made of cans]
