[episode begins at Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Thanks for having lunch with me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way. I could've spent my lunch drink. [slurps his drink and makes a relaxed face] Ahh.
Patrick: That's a pretty cool face. [chuckles] Check you this one out. [chomps, chews]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo! [laughs]
Patrick: Oh, hey, how about this? [dolphin call]
SpongeBob: That's awesome! [SpongeBob and Patrick both laugh]
Mr. Krabs: [snores] Ooh. I know this sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet! [SpongeBob and Patrick laughs] SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?
SpongeBob: Sorry, sir. I got carried away. Patrick and I here are making faces at each other.
Patrick: Funny faces make me laugh! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What? Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?
SpongeBob: Why, is there something wrong?
Mr. Krabs: Haven't ye ever heard the saying "If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way"?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uuh, no!
Mr. Krabs: Let me tell you the story of face freeze. [thunder claps, SpongeBob and Patrick's tooth chattering, breathing quickly] It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out. [Fred raspberries and laughs] But what he really liked, was to stick his tongue at people. [Fred raspberries and laughs, Sadie and green Monroe wasps]
Norma Rechid: How rude! [Monroe cries]
[Fred raspberries]
Mr. Krabs: Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time, [Fred raspberries] his face froze with his tongue sticking out...
Fred: Huh, huh... Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Permanently!
Mable: Weirdo.
Fred: [muffled] No... no!
Mr. Krabs: He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, no!
Mr. Krabs: So are you gonna keep making faces, boys?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mm-mm.
Mr. Krabs: Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.
SpongeBob: I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.
Patrick: Done and done.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.
Patrick: Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.
SpongeBob: No faces... at all. Yeah. This is... [gulps] easy. How you holding up?
Patrick: Huh, fine. You?
[SpongeBob grunts but makes an T-shaped face and laughs]
Patrick: [laughs] Dun ah eeh.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are both laughing, Until SpongeBob stops and looks at his himself]
SpongeBob: Hey! [Patrick is still ignoring him while laughing] Patrick. [pulls out a megaphone] Patrick!!!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.
[Patrick stretching]
Patrick: Gosh, you're right.
SpongeBob: Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true. Let's make lots of faces.
Patrick: You mean like this? [stretching] Ree eeh eeh!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both, SpongeBob growls]
Patrick: [laughs] Aye yi yi yi!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Aw!
Patrick: Phee!
SpongeBob: Ay yi yi yi yi yi!
Patrick: Dun ree ah yee!
SpongeBob: Doy doy doy doy!
Patrick: Ah ah ooh!
SpongeBob: Duh!
Patrick: Aydh!
SpongeBob: Awoot duh doo!
Patrick: Looo ooo ooo!
SpongeBob: Day ah dah da dah!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both]
SpongeBob: I can't breathe! [SpongeBob grabs and mirror and they look into it]Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.
Patrick: Yes! But, now do you choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross, [Makes his eyes go up to the top of his head] uh? And then slip into and overbite. [Pulling out upper jaw] And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one... [He pushed his nose, makes his mouth bigger and puts out his eyeballs on the top of his head] The Gary. Meow!
Patrick: [chuckles] Gloriously disgusting, sir.
SpongeBob: Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share then with the whole wide sea. [SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both]

[Everybody swims away screaming]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing again]

[scene cuts]
Patrick: Hey Spongebob!
[Patrick turns on Flashlight]
[SpongeBob and Patrick Laughing]
[Patrick turns off Flashlight]

[Patrick turns on Flashlight]
[SpongeBob and Patrick Laughing]
[Patrick turns off Flashlight]
Patrick: Hey SpongeBob!
[Patrick turns on Flashlight]
[SpongeBob and Patrick Laughing]

[Patrick turns off Flashlight]
[Squidward rips Tent]
Squidward: Would You Mind?!
SpongeBob: Mind What? Making Faces? Of course were don't.
[SpongeBob and Patrick Laughing]
SpongeBob: Your Turn Squidward let's see your Crazy Face.
Squidward: I don't wanna make faces I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!
SpongeBob: Hey! That's a good one right there.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughs]
Squidward: Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!
SpongeBob: Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!
Patrick: Oh yeah? Watch me.
[They both sleep]
Squidward: Whatever works.
[Later, the Sun rises]
SpongeBob: [Surprised] Wow Patrick, you did hold that face all night!
Patrick: Actually, I can't move my face at all [He feels on his face]
SpongeBob: I can't move my face either!
Patrick: All right! We did it!
SpongeBob: No Patrick, It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right! Patrick we have a Face Freeze!
[Both scream]
SpongeBob: Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sandy! Sandy!
[Later at Sandy's house]
Sandy: Hmmmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.
SpongeBob: And you're a licensed masseuse, right Sandy?
Sandy: Well I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension. [shows Sandy's hand looking creepy]
Sandy: You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. Fell them nights just meltin away. Let's see if i can just get that jaw line back in place. [Later, Sandy is done] Phew! OK you two bad news first. That wicked Face Freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed.
[showing that SpongeBob's and Patrick's faces are more deformed]
[At Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hello Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob walks with his back towards him to the kitchen and Mr. Krabs goes in as well]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, you all right boy, eh, look a little killy-wompish walking in here.
SpongeBob: Doing fine Mr. Krabs. Just grillin and grillin.
Mr. Krabs: Ahem. But what's with this cubed posture
[He touches SpongeBob's head and SpongeBob knocks his claw away]
SpongeBob: You hear that, someone just dropped a penny.
Mr. Krabs: (Gasps) Where?! Where?! [Looks for penny]
SpongeBob: That'll buy me some time.
Squidward: Let's go SpongeBob, the orders are pouring out.
SpongeBob: On it Squidward!
SpongeBob: [Onion juice gets in his eye] Onion juice! Ah!
Squidward: Come on SpongeBob! Chop, Chop!
SpongeBob: OK, OK.
SpongeBob: [Falls, retrieves patties on back, screams] Phew. Order up.
Squidward: You deliver it, I'm on break.
Mr. Krabs: Penny, penny, penny, penny.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is still distracted, now's my chance. Your order is served, sir.
Harold: [Gasps at that SpongeBob's lips is on the patties] I'm sorry, I did not order a side of lips with my patty!
SpongeBob: Oh, dear.
Harold: [Takes money out of register] I'm taking my clams, elsewhere.
Mr. Krabs: Wait, come back!
SpongeBob: Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face?
Mr. Krabs: What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?
SpongeBob: How should I know, I'm just a cook in these parts.
Mr. Krabs: Face me when I'm talking to you boy. [SpongeBob turns around with his face down] So I can see your face.
SpongeBob: Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs? [shows him a rolling trick] My impersonation of a burrito!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... Huh? [Sees Patrick walk in with Face Freeze]
Patrick: Oh. Uhhh, is this a bad time, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I see what's going on here. [Picks up SpongeBob] Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, we thought it was one of your stories.
Mr. Krabs: I'm losing business, because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ahhh! [Mr. Krabs' anger gives him a creepy face freeze, a train noise is heard] NO! I can't move my face. I've got a Face Freeze too!!
Squidward- What is the hold up in here?
SpongeBob- Wait Squidward, don't get worked up you could get the face freeze!
Squidward- Face freeze!? I thought that was a myth? Ha! Krabs too! ha ha ha!! (Begins laughing hard) This is rich! Ha ha ha! Oh. [Sees Patrick, begins laughing very hard and he too gets a Face Freeze and a other freezing noise is heard] Hey, my face! Aah, my face. Oh, great, look at what you've done. [Begins crying]
Mr. Krabs: LOOK! Squidward has it too!
[All three begin laughing while Squidward begins crying]
Squidward: HEY, IT'S NOT FUNNY! STOP LAUGHING!
