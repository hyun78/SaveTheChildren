Squidward: Question. Are you two acting even more infantile than usual this morning?
SpongeBob: Uh huh. Cause I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic, and we're playing with them. [Squidward pulls down blinds] Hey! My old teddy walrus! This stuff really takes me back. [hugs teddy walrus]

[slips on toy boatmobile, gets head stuck in scooter and crashes into his mailbox]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! [Squidward's head swells up]
Patrick: Hey, He's mumblin' and droolin' like a little baby.

Patrick: Hang in there buddy. we'll have you fixed up in no time. [SpongeBob and Patrick carries Squidward to the hospital]

Not to worry though, he should recover over normally over time, but he mustn't receive any more blows to the head or he may remain this way permanently. Just care for him as if were your very own bouncy baby boy and he'll be fine. [cuts to SpongeBob's house]

Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, Squidward, enough duff-dragging! Get to your stations, pronto!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition to perform his Krusty duties. [turns around to show Mr. Krabs that Squidward is a baby. Squidward makes baby noises] The poor guy has the mind of an infant.
Mr. Krabs: I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains. He needs to be behind that register. We've got customers out there just begging to hand me their money. [shows customers outside begging to come in with their money]
SpongeBob: But...
Mr. Krabs: No buts! Get to work, you two!

I can also count on huh... [notices that Squidward doodled on the pieces of paper] Will this be for here or to goo? [peeks out the kitchen window, where Squidward is laughing and tossing the papers around] We have to work on your penmanship, Squiddy. [Squidward laughs and doodles on Nat's face]
Nat: My face! My face! Also my leg, but mostly my face!
Pilar: Hey! Are you going to take an order or what? [Squidward opens the register, hits his head and cries]
